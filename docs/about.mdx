# About

Logos is a fully decentralised, privacy-preserving, and politically neutral technology stack that includes three modular protocols for consensus, storage, and messaging. Combined, they provide the technical foundation for cyber states, network states, or any borderless public institution based on voluntary consent.

Network states are digital communities that grow into self-governed societies, forming distinct cultures, economies, legal frameworks, and institutions By operating on sovereign digital infrastructure, they carve out autonomy from traditional nation-states, making them resistant to coercion and capture.

The World Bank identifies human and social capital as the most valuable assets in the world – more than the planet’s natural resources combined. As the legacy model, rooted in territoriality and inefficient institutions, struggles to keep up the changing landscape, network states represent a trillion-dollar opportunity to upgrade our societies while upholding the rights of billions.

To do so, Logos must bridge the digital divide. By fostering civil initiatives that fill in the gaps where legacy institutions have failed, we can build solutions that actually improve people’s lives. As more benefit from them, the legitimacy they gain sparks a virtuous growth cycle of freedom and prosperity that strengthens the underlying Logos network. 

As an open-source project, Logos is not just a collection of individuals. We come together by choice to address shared challenges, advance our principles, and create systems that benefit the whole through open contributions.
