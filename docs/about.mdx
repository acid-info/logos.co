# Exit injustice, enter prosperity

Logos is a sovereign technology stack that champions personal liberties and collective prosperity through efficient, decentralised institutions. It includes three protocols for consensus, messaging, and storage.

Contemporary human governance is inefficient and corrupt; reform has proven insufficient. We believe the solution lies in exit - we can improve our lives and protect our civil liberties through parallel institutions operating within existing states.

Although successful historical examples were local, the cypherpunks showed how this approach could be scaled through technology, allowing people to opt out of poor governance anywhere.

As Bitcoin did for money, Logos enables permissionless, censorship-resistant governance institutions that solve real problems. However, unlike most public blockchains, Logos protects privacy across the network, ensuring it remains sovereign and secure.

We believe everyone should have access to governance that reflects their values and improves their lives. All people should be free to exit hostile, corrupt, and inefficient systems. For the first time in history, we can achieve this.

As the legacy model, rooted in territoriality and coercion, struggles to keep up with the changing landscape, upgrading it is a trillion-dollar opportunity that would secure the rights of billions.

If you share our vision, help us build it. A network of builders beats a nation of bureaucrats.
