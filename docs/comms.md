# Waku

<p><u>Waku</u> is the peer-to-peer communication layer for the Logos network. It removes centralised third parties from messaging, enabling private, scalable, censorship-resistant communication.</p>

**Private**: Waku uses cutting-edge zk technology to protect applications from Denial of Service attacks. Tailor your application's privacy settings to suit your needs.

**Censorship resistant**: Decentralised human and machine communication, with no single point of failure. Waku’s native incentivization mechanism stimulates an expanding node distribution, promoting an increasingly secure network.

**Modular**: Waku protocols are adaptive, and can be customised based on unique demands. Waku is built to flourish even in resource-restricted environments like browsers and mobile devices.

**Scalable**: Waku employs message sharding for efficient throughput, while its discovery protocol ensures a user only connects to nodes serving messages they are interested in.

Waku is in production and is actively being used by projects like Status, Railgun, and TheGraph.
