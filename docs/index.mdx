# Protect freedom,<br/>accelerate prosperity

Logos is a sovereign, decentralised technology stack that realises the cypherpunk vision of autonomous digital territories and network states. It is designed to champion personal liberties and collective abundance through upgrading human governance.

As an open source movement, we need coders, creatives, and anyone passionate to help us build, own, and govern it.

Own your network, own your future.
