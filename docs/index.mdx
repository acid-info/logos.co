# About

Logos is a fully decentralised, privacy-preserving, and politically neutral technology stack that provides the necessary support for self-sovereign virtual territories. 

The stack includes three modular, blockchain-based protocols: Nomos (consensus), Codex (storage), and Waku (messaging). Combined, they provide the technical foundation for cyber states, parallel societies, network states, or any borderless public institution based on voluntary consent. 

Logos is also a collection of learning communities that will govern and sustain the network in the spirit of the original cypherpunks. Together they form the grassroots movement needed to build the social, economic, and governing institutions that will live on the technology stack. 

Eventually, these institutions will populate a competitive marketplace that can fill gaps in governance in the real world, providing trust-minimised, corruption-resistant public services  wherever the internet can reach.
