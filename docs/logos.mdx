# Logos is building a Network State

Logos is a grassroots movement to provide trust-minimized, corruption resistant governing services and social institutions to underserved citizens.

It all begins with the construction of shared public infrastructure that forms the foundation of Logos. The network is comprised of modular protocols for communication, file storage and transactions, which together form a complete decentralized infrastructure stack.

Logos’ infrastructure will provide a base for the provisioning of the next-generation of governing services and social institutions - paving the way to economic opportunities to those who need them most, whilst respecting basic human rights through the network’s design.

We invite technologists, creatives and policy experts – along with anyone who is passionate about our mission – to participate in its creation, and to help govern its future.

We will post more on how to join the community here soon.

  <h2>Declaration of Independence in Cyberspace</h2>
  <article>
    <p>Every once in a while a revolutionary idea comes along that changes everything. These ideas and technologies do not occur by chance, they are the aggregation of ancient trends and the inventiveness of millions. Language, agriculture, parliaments, the printing press, networked computing, blockchains and artificial intelligence all transformed our world forever, rearranging human societies with a vision for the future. Today we are bringing forth such a vision.</p>
    <p>To many of us it is obvious that the Westphalian Order that birthed the nation state is struggling to keep up with a multi-polar, interconnected world: the supra-national global elite is cannibalising its citizens and the fiat monetary system is collapsing before us in real time. We see this as the terminal phase of the Western project, a time of debt slavery, war, displacement, manipulation, corruption, bureaucracy, broken ecosystems, widespread surveillance, nihilist values, socialised impoverishment and the rise of populist authoritarianism on the left and the right.</p>
    <p>Across the world, we are sleepwalking into a series of interconnected catastrophes, the likes of which have not been witnessed since World War II. While most think the situation is hopeless, we know it’s not.</p>
    <p>To prove it, we are declaring independence from this dying order, reopening the frontier and establishing Logos, a self-sovereign network state founded on the solid ground of liberty, security, privacy, openness, decentralisation, inclusivity, innovation and resourcefulness.</p>
    <p>We are a collective of free thinkers, idealists and pioneers who are reopening the frontier, rejecting empty postmodernity and establishing Logos, a self-sovereign network state founded on the solid ground of liberty, security, privacy, openness, decentralisation, inclusivity, innovation and resourcefulness.</p>
    <p>Logos is the ancient Greek concept for the connection between language, reason and the order of the universe.For us, it represents a group of free thinkers, idealists, pioneers and builders searching for this immanent truth through conversation: a place to interact freely in a passionate, civilised and respectful manner, with the goal of collective liberation.</p>
    <p>Logos is a global nation of like minded peers We offer our citizens a global nation of like-minded peers, cutting edge tools designed to protect our basic rights from oppression, ownership of these technologies, a voice in their governance and the opportunity to make a difference.</p>
    <p>We offer meaning in a world starved of it.</p>
    <p>Our vision is to harness the transformational power of discovering together, building on our deep urge to invent and imagine a world beyond the authoritarian structures of the decaying status quo. Our mission is neither optional nor guided by chance, it is born out of necessity.</p>
    <p>We are at the critical juncture in history where the broken old system meets the new tools built to replace it, and we see no choice but to use them for our collective liberation. We know our success is inevitable.</p>
    <p>To achieve independence of the mind and the body, we are building a versatile and powerful toolkit.  The magic of cryptography gives us protection, while the resilience of blockchains allows for global, coordinated, hostile-resistant institutions.</p>
    <p>We were there at the beginning, when Bitcoin proved this dream was possible. We share its ethos and extend its properties to a user owned, self-governed network state.</p>
    <p>To do this we are taking on the challenge set in the initial vision for Ethereum: a fully decentralised tech stack, complete with p2p communications, file storage and a multi-chain ecosystem with network level privacy.</p>
    <p>On top of this infrastructure we are building a parallel society with consensus based governing services, a common law court system and a culture hard coded to respect individual sovereignty and fundamental human rights.</p>
    <p>What does a world where we succeed look like? What will your daily life be like in the Logos network state and how do we improve the problems our future citizens face?</p>
    <p>In our world your life is as private as you want it to be. We are not the first to argue that privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy, it is a fundamental right.</p>
    <p>In our world you own the services you use, no matter if you drive a taxi, start companies or organise politically. You own your communications, your apps, your marketplaces and your assets. This means a voice in their governance and a stake in their success.</p>
    <p>In our world, the rule of law is transparent, fair and the true basis of our wealth. Our accessible governance system means transactions cost a fraction of what they do in the corrupt captured legacy bureaucracy. In our world, courts are trustworthy and mediation is minimal.</p>
    <p>In our world we have a transparent, self-sovereign monetary policy that serves the interests of our citizens. Your assets are sovereign and secure. Protected legally and technologically, from outside and within. Logos is a digital Switzerland of the future age.</p>
    <p>In our world culture is free, forkable and open: freedom of expression is guaranteed by our underlying technology. If you do not agree with what you have consented to, you are free to leave or remix.</p>
    <p>In our world hegemony is replaced by consent, because hegemony is not only oppressive but inefficient, stifling creativity and limiting the potential for discovery. Logos is the next step in the evolution of society, from warlike and poverty-stricken barbarism to a prosperous civilisation of voluntary harmony.</p>
    <p>In our world nation state tribalism has given way to a shared essence of language, culture, communication and ethics. Common glories manifested in voluntary consent to a shared imagination, mission and eventually, territory.</p>
    <p>In our world the answers will not come from one person, one institution or one group. We believe the smallest minority is the individual, and we enable plurality instead of tolerating or censoring it.</p>
    <p>In our world people are not treated like machines because people, not machines, are at the centre of what we envision.</p>
    <p>Our world is anonymous and not elitist. We do not care who you are. We do not care about your gender, race or nationality. We judge ideas on their own merit and value relations through dialogue. We are people powered software and we are relevant because of our uncompromising beliefs.</p>
    <p>We are bringing about the second enlightenment of the digital world, because the internet was not built for totalitarian control but for prosperity and emancipation.</p>
    <p>We also believe no one is free until we are all free, because no one is an island: we are all pieces of the main.We know there is going to be a pushback on what we create, but the reward is a freedom nobody has ever felt before.</p>
    <p>We will stop only when any person, anywhere, can experience it.</p>
    <p>Because of this, we cannot do it alone.</p>
    <p>If we are your people, join us.</p>
