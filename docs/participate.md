In the initial phases, Logos will require developer education and advocacy, but will also focus on people who share our principles and political views. Rather than remaining completely apolitical, we are actively looking for those interested in helping shape this vision and govern its future. At the foundation of what we envision is a passionate but civilised conversation.

We invite technologists, creatives, and policy experts, along with anyone passionate about our mission, to participate in its creation and help govern its future.
