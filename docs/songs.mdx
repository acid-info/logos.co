# Defend Public Goods with Codex

The Internet Archive is a digital library that provides access to millions of cultural artefacts, including literature, audio, and video. It is a resource that supports the research of authors and academics around the world and acts as the collective history of the Internet.

This public good is now under threat of disappearing. 

In 2023, major record labels sued the not-for-profit Internet Archive for over $600 million over its “Great 78 Project”. If successful, the legal action threatens the very existence of a piece of critical Internet infrastructure.

Durable archiving is crucial to the preservation of human cultures and vital to the way we organise, govern, and progress together. This is why decentralisation matters, because our access to key information should not depend on those who can censor and erase it.

Public goods like the Internet Archive running on centralised infrastructure remain vulnerable to such targeted attacks. The first step to ensuring their long-term survival is to develop alternative protocols that resist coercion and censorship by design. 

This is why we are building Codex – the storage layer of the Logos technology stack – as an open-source data protocol to allow anyone to durably preserve what is valuable to them, protecting open knowledge for future generations. 

Codex is now live on testnet, and we need your help to battle-test it. Join us in running a node and building decentralised archiving solutions to support public goods projects like the Internet Archive.
