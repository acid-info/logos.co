# Codex

<p><u>Codex</u> is a decentralised data storage platform that provides exceptionally strong censorship resistance and durability guarantees. It is the data storage layer of the Logos Network.</p>

**Durable**: Codex uses a technique known as erasure coding to efficiently ensure data is always available without the storage costs associated with replicating the data. Codex is also a protocol that is friendly to resource-restricted devices, and can endure high levels of churn and large numbers of ephemeral devices.

**Censorship resistant**: Centralised cloud storage providers have an established history of censoring data and, as de facto owners of said data, have the power to do so according to their own standards. Codex has no power to censor data, and protects against censorship and data loss from DDoS attacks, data corruption, and even the shutdown of a significant number of nodes.

**Decentralised**: Codex's incentivization mechanism promotes wide participation of data storage providers, both small and large, thus ensuring a robust network resistant to censorship and external attack.

**Accessible**: Participating in the Codex network is highly accessible thanks to its permissionless nature and bandwidth usage optimizations like its "lazy repair" recovery system. 

Codex has a working PoC, and is expected to have a live testnet in production by Q4 2023.
